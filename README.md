# My Next.js Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## 📦 Getting Started

First, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the app by modifying files in the `app` directory. The project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) for automatic font optimization.
